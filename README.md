Hi, I’m @craigblackham and I’m interested in coding and hobby robotics. I’m currently learning to get more comfortable with git via the command line rather than relying on a GUI.
Most of what you'll find here are a lightweight PHP framework and various python scripts meant to run on a raspberry pi to interact with the real world via GPIO.
